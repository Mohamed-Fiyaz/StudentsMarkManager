# Students' Mark Management System (School Project)
This Python script is a basic Students' Management System that interacts with a MySQL database to manage student marks and information. The system provides a menu-driven interface for performing various operations related to student records.

## Features

- Add new student records
- View marks of students
- Change marks of students
- Check the topper in different subjects
- Check passed or failed students

## MySQL Tables

This system uses two MySQL tables to store student information: `PCMCS` for Computer Science students and `PCMB` for Biology students.
